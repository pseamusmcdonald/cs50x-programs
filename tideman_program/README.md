# Tideman Program

This program implements a Tideman (ranked pair) election and was done along with my self-study of CS50X.

To compile: 

```bash
$ make tideman
```
*This program is meant to be compiled with clang.*

### How to use

```bash
$ ./tideman max jack able
How many voters?: 4

Winner: jack
Winner: 3
```
