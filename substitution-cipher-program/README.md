# Substitution Cipher Program

This program implements an alphabetic substitution cipher and was done along with my self-study of CS50X.

To compile: 

```bash
$ make substitution
```
*This program is meant to be compiled with clang.*

### How to use

```bash
$ ./substitution ADSFHGJKLZVXCBMNQRWETYUIOP # Key must be 26 chars. Chars should be unique.
Plaintext: Hello, Github.
Ciphertext: Khxxm, Jlektd.
```
