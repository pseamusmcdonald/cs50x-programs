One of the many ways companies try to stay competitive is by merging with or acquiring different companies; these processes are known as mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The primary law dictating mergers and acquisitions within the U.S. is Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Put shortly, § 7 of the Clayton Act forbids M&A deals where “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. (Clayton Act § 7, 1914)” By disallowing companies the ability to freely merge and conglomerate, this law intends to safeguard competition against the monopolistic purchasing of competitors.
