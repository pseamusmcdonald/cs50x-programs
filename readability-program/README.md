# Readability Program

This program uses the Colemanâ€“Liau to produce a readability score ranging from 1-16, representing first grade and a senior undergraduate student, respectively. This was done along with my self-study of CS50X.

**Note** You must use a .txt file!

To compile: 

```bash
$ make readability
```
*This program is meant to be compiled with clang.*

### How to use

```bash
$ ./readability ./texts/example.txt 
Reading Level: 11
```
