# Plurality Vote Program

This program lets you take a simple plurality vote and was done along with my self-study of CS50X.

To compile: 

```bash
$ make plurality
```
*This program is meant to be compiled with clang.*

### How to use

```bash
$ ./plurality max jake paul
Number of voters: 6

Vote: max
Vote: paul
Vote: paul
max
```
